# A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT ONLINE PAYMENT FRAUD

Over time, fraudulent online transactions have resulted in enormous harm and loss to many people and businesses. To minimize these losses, efficient and practical fraud detection algorithms must be implemented. The identification of fraudulent transactions relies heavily on statistical and machine-learning approaches.

# Objectives
(i)To build a Machine Learning model to predict online payment fraud and (ii) To compare different classification Algorithms to understand which is best suitable for our dataset/application.

# Challenge
Since there are very few fraudulent transactions in the dataset, it is challenging to spot the frauds.

# Tools Used
Jupyter notebook, pandas (used for reading and transforming the data), seaborn (used to generate charts and visualizations), sklearn (used for machine learning tasks)

# What I Did
EDA (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis)

Data Preprocessing (Feature engineering, Encoding, Scaling)

Model Building (Splitting, Training Model evaluation)

# Conclusion
Decision tree classifier Algorithm has the highest accuracy level which means the model was able to accurately predict 90% of our dataset/application. It performs much better in detecting fraud.
